This is a practice exercise, following this [Devwalks](https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-in-rails-part-1/) tutorial to build a clone of Instagram.
The aim is to expand my comfort zone by getting more practice with building functioning Rails apps, as well as user authentication and frontend styling with HTML/CSS/Bootstrap.
